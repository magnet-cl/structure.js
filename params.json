For example, *\"This user object contains an id, an email and a username\"*. But this is not the only case, sometimes you also need to test if these fields are what you were expecting them to be. In the previous example, username should be a string of minimum 5 characters, the id should be an integer and the email should satisfy an email regular expression.\r\n\r\nAnother typical test case is when you are working on a team and interfaces are defined. The previous example shows such an example of such interface.\r\n\r\nThus, Structure-js comes to the rescue. You can easily define the structure of your expected objects and test if any object complies. A  list with the tests results is given to you, explaining what went wrong and which field caused the problem.\r\n\r\n#Examples\r\n\r\n##Basic validations\r\nA basic example is the validation of a simple user, first you need to define a schema for your objects:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar s = new Structure({\r\n    id: Number,\r\n    first_name: String,\r\n    last_name: String\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNow, given the following objects:\r\n```javascript\r\nvar user1 = {id: 1, first_name: \"Good\", last_name: \"Guy\"};\r\nvar user2 = {id: \"2\", first_name: \"Bad\", last_name: \"Guy\"};\r\n```\r\nYou can test if they match your expected pattern:\r\n```javascript\r\ns.test(user1); // returns true\r\ns.test(user2); // returns false\r\n```\r\nAlso you can check the test results:\r\n```\r\n>>> s.results\r\n[ { ok: false,\r\n    message: 'Type of object.first_name is string, expecting number' },\r\n  { ok: true,\r\n    message: 'Type of object.first_name is string' },\r\n  { ok: true,\r\n    message: 'Type of object.last_name is string' }]\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Nested validations\r\nYou can go deeper declaring nested structures for your validations\r\n```javascript\r\nvar s = new Structure({\r\n    id: Number,\r\n    name: String,\r\n    location: {\r\n        latitude: Number,\r\n        longitude: Number\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNote that location is defined as a nested structure, you can nest as many levels as you want.\r\n\r\n##Non-basic types\r\nYou can use Structre.js to test against regular expressions or user defined prototypes\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Animal = function(name){\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n    /*\r\n        ... Animal implementation ...\r\n     */\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar s = new Structure({\r\n    username: /^\\w+$/,\r\n    pet: Animal\r\n});\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
